Write a python script to ingest a large csv file containing boc3
filers data, and write the data to a google sheet using the Google
sheets API.  The large boc3 file is called
`boc3_allwithhistory_and_header.txt`. It has column headings in the
first line.  Attached you'll find another script we wrote together
that imports another data set to google sheets. We can reuse the
client_secret.json file and the identifier for the google sheet. You
do not need to explain how to set that up, I already have it set up
for the other script (`direct_to_sheet.py`). For reference I've also
attached an extract of the first 20 lines of the big csv file so you
can see the format. Use the same rules as `direct_to_sheet.py` in
terms of number of rows per tab, progress meter display, retries etc.
Make sure the entries in the sheet are sorted by COMPANY_NAME so that we can see all
of a single company's records together, for example if "Bob Smith" is a filer I'd
like to see all their entries on a single tab. If this means that any
filer might span two or more google sheet tabs, then move that filer
to the next tab rather than having them split across two tabs.
